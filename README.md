# Backend Project Structure Explanation

Based on your file structure, here's a breakdown of your backend project:

## Root Directory: backend/
The main backend folder containing all server-side code

### Controllers/
- agentController.js: Contains business logic for agent-related operations
- userController.js: Contains business logic for user authentication and management

### Middleware/
Custom middleware functions (authentication, validation, error handling, etc.)

### Models/
- agentmodel.js: Database schema/model for agents
- tasksmodel.js: Database schema/model for tasks
- usermodel.js: Database schema/model for users

### node_modules/
Contains all npm packages and dependencies (auto-generated by npm)

### Routes/
- agentroutes.js: Defines API endpoints for agent operations
- useroutes.js: Defines API endpoints for user operations

### Uploads/
Directory where uploaded files (CSV, XLSX, XLS) are stored

### Configuration Files
- .env: Environment variables (database credentials, JWT secrets, etc.)
- config.json: Additional configuration settings
- package.json: Project metadata and dependencies list
- package-lock.json: Exact dependency versions for reproducibility

### Main Application File
- index.js: Entry point of the Node.js/Express application

## How It Works Together:
1. index.js sets up Express server, connects to database
2. Routes receive HTTP requests and call appropriate controllers
3. Controllers handle business logic and interact with models
4. Models define database schemas and handle data operations
5. Middleware processes requests before reaching controllers (auth, validation)
6. Uploads/ stores files uploaded through the application
